# Plant_disease_classifier
The model classifies differnt types of plant disease from leaf images. The model uses transfer learning on Resnet-50 to achieve 76% accuracy. Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. ImageDatagenerator was used to allocate a training set and validation set. A global Avg pool and dense layer was added for 38 classes at the end of resnet. The model was trained till 10 epoch while a condition was applied to only train the last 20% of resnet not the whole as the first 80% layers are used to identify edges and shapes in an image whereas last 20% is used for classification.Model was trained with batch size of 32 i.e set of only 32 images were passed through the net once this was done to lower the memory requirment. The dataset is downloaded from "https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/1"
